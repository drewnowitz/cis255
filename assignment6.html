<p>While it causes some inconveniences on my end, ultimately the same-origin policy 
is beneficial to security. A callback function is a function which acts as an argument 
to another function. I don't think it's a good way to make each item of a list a different 
color because that doesn't seem to be something it's capable of, at least not reasonably. 
The included page you linked for jQuery.map() accomplishes this with CSS and uses map
more to modify each element of an array in a specific way, such as doubling each value
or capitalizing each value. Nowhere in the examples is jQuery.map() used to change colors
and I couldn't find anything on this using Google.</p>
